# Changelog

All notable changes to claude-practices. Versions follow semver-ish intent:
minor = new capability, patch = fix/cleanup.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-29 (Treaty of Versailles)
### Changed
- Normalized all skills to `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` directory form.
- Replaced hand-copy README blocks with idempotent `install.sh` / `install.ps1`.
- Single source of truth for the skills tables (methodology → `session-workflow` skill; applicability → `META_ARCHITECTURE.md`).
- Framed Python tooling in `tool-discipline.md` as a swappable default.

### Added
- `VERSION` and this changelog.

### Notes
- Foundation for back-half hardening (Waves 1–3): INVARIANTS.md, feynman-explainer,
  Minion-themed agents, verification/evals rules, native-/goal loop discipline.
  See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-29-claude-practices-hardening-design.md`.

## [0.1.0] — prior
- Initial kit: templates, thinking trio, session-workflow, init, labarr-ml, SessionStart hook.
